## contradictions

| id | status | effort | description | notes |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| CONTRA-04 | blocked | M | Reconcile private-article exclusion with reopening mutable source XML after publication policy checks. | High; README.md:133 excludes private content, but articulous/pipeline.py:1151 checks parsed metadata, articulous/pipeline.py:781,876 hash/queue a path, and articulous/engines.py:213 later parses that path again. Reproduced: change an article to `private` and replace its description after planning but before workers run; the build succeeds and publishes the new private description. Unblock by choosing a consistent input snapshot or fail-on-change policy, sharing the validated bytes with rendering/fingerprinting, and verifying concurrent edits cannot publish unchecked content. |
| CONTRA-05 | blocked | M | Define and enforce handling of contradictory singleton XML fields. | High; articulous/articles.py:110 silently keeps the last title/date/language/status, while the shipped article stylesheet selects the first title (tests/fixtures/site/xsl/pages/article.xsl:7). Reproduced: two different titles produce one title on the article page and another in its slug/search entry; `<status>private</status><status>published</status>` silently publishes the article despite the conflicting privacy declaration. Unblock by defining an explicit duplicate-field policy, rejecting conflicting declarations before publication, and verifying consistent page/listing metadata plus fail-closed status handling. |

## Open — parked

| id | status | effort | description | notes |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| OBS-01 | parked | S | `_stream_projections` emits no per-section progress; only final tally/plan logs are emitted (articulous/pipeline.py:1114; articulous/pipeline.py:1206) | Deliberate to keep production logs quiet; revisit if very large sites need progress feedback. |
| OBS-02 | parked | S | `timed()` wraps tasks at DEBUG only; production builds see no per-task signal (articulous/runtime.py:145) | Same trade-off as OBS-01; bumping to INFO would flood logs for normal builds. |
| DOC-01 | parked | S | `SiteModelCtx` `@property` members carry no docstrings (articulous/models.py:34) | Protocol members read as self-documenting from the type annotations; revisit only if external API consumers complain. |

## Audit picks deliberately rejected

| id | description | reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| PERF-01 | XSL hashed per-section, not per-item | Intentional amortisation; per-item hash would re-read XSL N times. |
| PERF-02 | In-memory XML model hashed directly, not via temp file | Intentional optimisation; documented at use site. |
| SCAL-01 | Tag grouping retains per-language article references | One traversal groups tag memberships; the memory cost is scoped to one language's tag pages. |
| CC-01 | `_stream_projections` collects multiple projections in one pass | The shared scan is intentional; helpers separate projection logic without additional article-discovery passes. |
| DUP-01 | Section builders share a planning structure | Model construction differs by section; task creation already uses common XSLT/native helpers. |
| REL-01 | `save_cache` swallows `TypeError` | Intentional: a broken cache write must never crash the build. |
| REL-02 | `_stream_projections` tally counts published pages matching CLI filters | Correct by design; "Discovered N" counts selected article pages while shared projections retain their complete inputs. |
| UNUSED-01 | `deep_merge` (articulous/config.py:57) used only by `load_or_create_config` | Internal helper with direct unit tests; keep. |
| UNUSED-02 | `build_articles_section` / `build_index_section` / `build_tags_section` (pipeline.py) are dispatched through `_add_per_lang_tasks` | Intentional test seams covered by `tests/test_pipeline.py`; keep. |
| DOC-03 | private helpers `_passes_cli_filters` / `_add_per_lang_tasks` (pipeline.py) carry no docstrings | Per AGENTS.md "default to no comments"; helpers are short and self-named. Skip. |
| DUP-02 | `_collect_cross_lang_plan` body repeats `if want(...): plan[...] = build_X_section(...)` | Each branch's call signature differs (rss_articles vs sitemap_urls vs search_items); table-driving would obscure not clarify. Same rationale as DUP-01. |
