| ARCH-001 | open | M | Review reusable generator capabilities supplied or duplicated by Morpha: canonical language roots/page-one routes, pagination and route discovery, static pages, tag indexes, 404 models and sitemap inclusion. Also assess public composition APIs for generated-output validation and whole-site publication. | Moved from `morpha-portal/TODO.md:ARCH-001` (medium priority). Compare `articulous/models.py:build_index_models`, `sections.py`, `pipeline.py` and `filesystem.py` with Morpha's `portal/build.py:archive_models`, `plan`, `publish`, `portal/catalog.py:articulous_routes` and `portal/validate.py`. Reuse existing engine locking/atomic-write capabilities where appropriate; native Windows remains unsupported as documented in README. Present keep/move/split recommendations, costs and public API contracts before implementation. Required regression plan: canonical roots without page-one aliases, empty-language landings, full pagination, output collisions, sitemap inclusion and failed-build preservation. Informs Morpha's COMPAT-003/HOST-004 decisions; content, theme, contact/project data and hosting policy remain portal-owned. Backlog transfer does not approve changing existing tests/contracts. |

| TYPE-001 | open | S | Restore the documented Pyright check for the bare-default-language and per-language RSS tests. | `.venv/bin/pyright --pythonpath .venv/bin/python` reports 36 errors in `tests/test_bare_default_language.py` and `tests/test_rss_per_language.py`: inferred heterogeneous `BuildCtx` keyword dictionaries, `SimpleNamespace` fixtures that do not satisfy `SiteModelCtx`, and an unresolved `lxml.etree` import. These precede the TODO transfer. Use accurately typed fixtures/constructor arguments and the project's supported import typing; retain all behavioral and invalid-input assertions. Resolve when the full type check and affected tests pass without suppressions or relaxed checks. |

## Open — parked

| id | status | effort | description | notes |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| DOC-01 | parked | S | `SiteModelCtx` `@property` members carry no docstrings (articulous/models.py:34) | Protocol members read as self-documenting from the type annotations; revisit only if external API consumers complain. |

## Audit picks deliberately rejected

| id | description | reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| PERF-01 | XSL hashed per-section, not per-item | Intentional amortisation; per-item hash would re-read XSL N times. |
| PERF-02 | In-memory XML model hashed directly, not via temp file | Intentional optimisation; documented at use site. |
| SCAL-01 | Tag grouping retains per-language article references | One traversal groups tag memberships; the memory cost is scoped to one language's tag pages. |
| CC-01 | `_stream_projections` collects multiple projections in one pass | The shared scan is intentional; helpers separate projection logic without additional article-discovery passes. |
| DUP-01 | Section builders share a planning structure | Model construction differs by section; task creation already uses common XSLT/native helpers. |
| REL-01 | `save_cache` swallows `TypeError` | Intentional: a broken cache write must never crash the build. |
| REL-02 | `_stream_projections` tally counts published pages matching CLI filters | Correct by design; "Discovered N" counts selected article pages while shared projections retain their complete inputs. |
| UNUSED-01 | `deep_merge` (articulous/config.py:57) used only by `load_or_create_config` | Internal helper with direct unit tests; keep. |
| UNUSED-02 | `build_articles_section` / `build_index_section` / `build_tags_section` (pipeline.py) are dispatched through `_add_per_lang_tasks` | Intentional test seams covered by `tests/test_pipeline.py`; keep. |
| DOC-03 | private helpers `_passes_cli_filters` / `_add_per_lang_tasks` (pipeline.py) carry no docstrings | Per AGENTS.md "default to no comments"; helpers are short and self-named. Skip. |
| DUP-02 | `_collect_cross_lang_plan` body repeats `if want(...): plan[...] = build_X_section(...)` | Each branch's call signature differs (rss_articles vs sitemap_urls vs search_items); table-driving would obscure not clarify. Same rationale as DUP-01. |
