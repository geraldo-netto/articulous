| DOC-04 | open | S | README engine guidance contradicts production selection: the configuration table omits `native`, and development notes claim missing Saxon forces lxml for every section (`README.md:175`, `README.md:240-241`, `articulous/engines.py:339-343`) | Document `native` for sitemap/search and limit fallback wording to sections explicitly configured with `saxonc`. Native sections remain native regardless of Saxon availability. |

## Open — parked

| id | status | effort | description | notes |
|----|--------|--------|-------------|-------|
| OBS-01 | parked | S | `_stream_projections` emits no per-section progress; only final tally/plan logs are emitted (articulous/pipeline.py:838-874; articulous/pipeline.py:923-941) | Deliberate to keep production logs quiet; revisit if very large sites need progress feedback. |
| OBS-02 | parked | S | `timed()` wraps tasks at DEBUG only; production builds see no per-task signal (articulous/runtime.py:144-152) | Same trade-off as OBS-01; bumping to INFO would flood logs for normal builds. |
| DOC-01 | parked | S | `SiteModelCtx` `@property` members carry no docstrings (articulous/models.py:25-47) | Protocol members read as self-documenting from the type annotations; revisit only if external API consumers complain. |

## Audit picks deliberately rejected

| id | description | reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| PERF-01 | XSL hashed per-section, not per-item | Intentional amortisation; per-item hash would re-read XSL N times. |
| PERF-02 | In-memory XML model hashed directly, not via temp file | Intentional optimisation; documented at use site. |
| SCAL-01 | Tag-page build is O(T*A) per language | Bound is per-language and per-tag, acceptable for any realistic site. |
| CC-01 | `_stream_projections` accumulates 3 lists + heap in single pass | Density is the point of single-pass streaming; splitting would re-walk articles. |
| DUP-01 | 5 section builders follow the same pattern | Each builder is 3-5 lines; extracting a helper would obscure not clarify. |
| REL-01 | `save_cache` swallows `TypeError` | Intentional: a broken cache write must never crash the build. |
| REL-02 | `_stream_projections` skips filter failures; final count reflects post-filter total | Correct by design; the logged "Discovered N" describes what was built. |
| UNUSED-01 | `deep_merge` (config.py:53) used only by `load_or_create_config` | Internal helper with direct unit tests; keep. |
| UNUSED-02 | `build_articles_section` / `build_index_section` / `build_tags_section` (pipeline.py) called only from `_collect_tasks` | Intentional test seams covered by `tests/test_pipeline.py`; keep. |
| DOC-03 | private helpers `_passes_cli_filters` / `_add_per_lang_tasks` (pipeline.py) carry no docstrings | Per AGENTS.md "default to no comments"; helpers are short and self-named. Skip. |
| DUP-02 | `_collect_cross_lang_plan` body repeats `if want(...): plan[...] = build_X_section(...)` | Each branch's call signature differs (rss_articles vs sitemap_urls vs search_items); table-driving would obscure not clarify. Same rationale as DUP-01. |
